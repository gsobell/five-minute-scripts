Trying out [`mermaid`](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) diagrams.
PNGs and SVGs generated with [mermaid.live](mermaid.live) since [`chromium`](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli) is a dependency for [`mermaid-cli`](https://github.com/mermaidjs/mermaid.cli).
Would love to see [`mermaid`](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) integration in [asciiflow](asciiflow.com), or a similar toolkit.
