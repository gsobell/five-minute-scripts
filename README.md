# five minute scripts
A repo of short scripts, always pointless, and sometimes humorous.

All the scripts here either are self explanatory, or can't be explained.

The purpose of this repo is to practice by putting into practice. Textbook exercises tend to be lame. This is a playground to reinforce what I'm learning, by thinking up [often outlandish] real-world use cases. A script is complete when it just barely runs. No edge cases will be tested. No optimization will not be done. Run at your own risk.
