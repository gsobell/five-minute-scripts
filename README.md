# five minute scripts
A repo of short scripts, always pointless, and sometimes humorous.

All the scripts here either are self explanatory, or can't be explained.

> "Move fast and make things weird"

A script is complete when it just barely runs. No edge cases will be tested. No optimization will be done.
